# Shopify Tailwind Starter

This starter is configured for a manual build-and-commit workflow with direct Shopify Git integration. It does not use GitHub Actions for building or deploying; instead, all compiled production assets are tracked and committed directly to the Git repository.

## Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   Run the local Shopify CLI dev server and automatically compile CSS and JS on change (watch mode):
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Build for Production**:
   Before making any commit or pushing changes, you must compile the assets locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
   This generates the production-ready files in the `assets/` folder (`theme.css`, `theme.js`, `prodify.js`).

3. **Commit & Push**:
   The compiled assets in `assets/` are tracked by Git (despite being ignored locally in `.gitignore`). When you commit and push to your main branch (e.g., `main`), Shopify's Git integration automatically pulls the repository and updates your theme.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Build and development changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Shopify CLI Setup

Create a `shopify.theme.toml` file in the root directory for local development:

```toml
[environments.development]
store = "your-store.myshopify.com"
theme = "" # Leave empty to use a safe, automatic development theme
store-password = "your-store-password" # only if the store has password protection
```
